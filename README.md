# Online Campus Network Auction System 

CS6110 - Object oriented analysis and Design - Course Project

The online auction system based on the campus network is a type of customers to customer (C2C) business model that facilitates interaction among university students and is a platform for exchange the goods information among students in the university.  

Particularly, it offers the trade platform to buyers and sellers together with the campus network. The buyers like to do the trading on the online auction system, because the system brings out the advantages, for example, on the one hand the system employs computer technology to accelerate results of bidding activities in force and economize human resources, on this side, it does not restrict the number of students who want to participate in; on the other hand the system offers a large amount of goods information, and makes students firmly believe that they can buy the cheap goods through the online auction system. The system mainly includes the functions that are divided into user management, goods management, auction management, etc. 

In this project, we propose to use the UML technique to analyze and design the online auction system based on the campus network.The goal of this project is to present the scheme to design and integrate modeling the online auction system in real-time.
